# Travel-Time-Prediction-using-KNN-Algorithm
Using K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm to Predict Travel Time

Here the KNN Algorithm is implemented from scratch.

This repository builts a Travel Time Prediction model to predict travelling time between 2 different places based on a random traffic dataset.
The vehicle considered here is a 4 wheeler(Taxi).

Following are the parameters which are considered for the prediction:
DriverRaing - How good the driver is.
RoadWorks - Represents the number of constructions or works that are being carried out in the way.
Weather - Indicating Weather Conditions.
Temperature - Giving the temperature value.

The Inputs are taken by the user based on the present traffic conditions in a very simple and basic GUI created using Tkinter in python and results are also displayed in the GUI in the lower frame.

You can find some illustrations of how the input and output looks like in the Outputs folder ,there are some screenshots for reference.
